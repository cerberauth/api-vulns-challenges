# Strong HTTP Basic

This challenge demonstrates a secure API using strong HTTP Basic authentication.

## How to run it

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Modes

The server supports two modes, toggled with the `--vulnerable` flag on the `serve` command (defaults to `true`):

```bash
# vulnerable: well-known credentials (admin/password) and a non-constant-time comparison are used
go run main.go serve --vulnerable=true

# fixed: randomly generated credentials and a constant-time comparison are used
go run main.go serve --vulnerable=false
```
