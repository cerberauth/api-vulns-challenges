# API Vulnerabilities Challenges

Welcome to the API Vulnerabilities Challenges repository! This project aims to provide a collection of deliberately vulnerable APIs along with corresponding challenges to help individuals and security professionals enhance their skills in identifying, exploiting, and securing API vulnerabilities. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about API security or an experienced penetration tester, this repository offers a valuable resource for self-training and testing of security tools.

## Why API Vulnerabilities Challenges?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a fundamental part of modern web applications and are crucial for data exchange between different systems. However, the increasing reliance on APIs has also made them a prime target for attackers. To mitigate risks and protect sensitive data, it's essential to understand common API vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

This repository serves the following purposes:

1. **Educational Resource**: Learn about various API vulnerabilities, such as Authentication Bypass, and more through hands-on challenges.
2. **Testing Ground**: Use these intentionally vulnerable APIs to test and validate the effectiveness of your security scanning and penetration testing tools.
3. **Skill Enhancement**: Develop your skills in identifying and exploiting API vulnerabilities, which are valuable for securing web applications and systems.
4. **Security Awareness**: Raise awareness about the importance of API security among developers and security professionals.
